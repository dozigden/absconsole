This is a quick console app that uses the [AudioBookShelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org) api to set a sequence number metadata parsed from a title on a series of books.

I had a large number of books from a Humble Bundle that needed updating.

It needs the `API URL and API Token setting in the appsettings.json file.  You can get the token in the user page in the front end of ABS.
